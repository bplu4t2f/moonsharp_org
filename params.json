The code is,  however,  heavily unoptimized. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Roadmap**\r\n\r\n* support for all core language structures (see documentation for differences between Moon# and Lua)\r\n* optimizations \r\n* better integration between Lua/Moon# tables and CLR objects\r\n* debugger embeddable in applications using Moon# \r\n* REPL interpreter\r\n* standard library \r\n\r\n**Associated Resources**\r\n\r\n* You can see the future backlog and status on [https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1082626](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1082626 \"Moon# Backlog on Pivotal Tracker\")\r\n* You can read some posts about the design choices of Moon# on my blog: http://www.mastropaolo.com/category/programming/moonsharp/\r\n\r\n\r\n**License**\r\n\r\nThe program and libraries are released under a 3-clause BSD license - see the license section.\r\n\r\nThis work is based on the ANTLR4 Lua grammar Copyright (c) 2013, Kazunori Sakamoto.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
