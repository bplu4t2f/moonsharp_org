Latest release: <a href="changelog.html" class="alert-link">0.5.5</a>.

Next scheduled release: 22 Oct 2014.



#### 2014-10-17

The string library has been completed. 
For the sake of not reinventing the wheel (or, at least, not reinventing *every* wheel), it was ported from KopiLua code.
In the process, a compatibility layer has been implemented to ease the porting of code using classic stack-based APIs like
KopiLua, UniLua or Lua itself.

On a side note, visit <a href="http://www.darkdale.net" class="alert-link">www.darkdale.net</a>. It's the project of a friend, 
a dungeon crawler on the spirit of Eye of the Beholder, Lands of Lore and Legend of Grimrock and it uses MoonSharp as a 
scripting engine!
